        My name is Michael Johnson. I am a software engineer major. I love to do things outdoors
        and mess around with computers as well. I have built multiple computers 
        and would consider it an active hobby. I am currently married; my wife and I got married
        a year ago. In software engineering, you will run into a lot of assignments to update or write
        scripts to maintain multiple platforms, with websites/webpages being one of them. I have been a member
        my entire life and continue to be active, doing my best to serve the lord.
